PYTUYO - communicate with MITUTOYO USB-ITN cables using pyusb

proof-of-concept code showing how to connect to and request readings from a
mitutoyo indicator via the USB-ITN cable.  Tested on linux.

The USB-ITN cable enumerates as an HID device, but can be used as a Virtual
Comm Port (VCP) by sending data over the control endpoint and reading responses on
the interrupt IN endpoint.  This VCP functionality requires performing an
initial control transfer with 0xA5A5 as wValue.  The USB-ITN then responds to
the host with a single byte data response of 0x01 over the control endpoint.
